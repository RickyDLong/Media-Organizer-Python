Television shows

 - Idea -

 Television shows have a format to them S0xE0x (ex: s02e09)

 The idea here is to find all television shows that are in the same directory as my movie files (because it moves
 all files of that format there) and organize them into a subdirectory to be found easier inside kodi.

 E:/Movie Folder/Television Shows/showname/season/episode

Todo:
Create regex string that will detect specifically that format
  - Move those to television shows movie_directory
    -figure out how to make the script organize them into individual named folders using regex to detect their show
     name and season



Remove All Junk from Download folders they are in
