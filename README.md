# Media-Organizer-Python

This project is sort of a mess. It is one of the first projects I did when starting to learn python. As you can see from the layout, much more planning could have been done to ensure it was more fluid. I do plan on coming back to this in the future and really cleaning things up.

# What this script does..

It searches through a targeted directory and deletes specified file types, it then moves other filetypes (such as music or movie files) to another directory, stripping them of their folders and subdirectories. In the end it goes back and cleans up what it left behind....like I said, its a mess.
